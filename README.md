# shopify-gulp-browsersync-webpack-hmr
Shopify local development environment using Gulp 4, BrowserSync proxy mode with css injection &amp; Webpack 4 for JS Hot Module Replacement. Can't make the jump to using [Shopify Slate](https://github.com/Shopify/slate) with an existing theme but want to benefit from a real development environment that syncs changes accross different browsers in a fast and efficient way using the latest building tools? This is the solution for you!

IMPORTANT NOTE: This repository is meant for developers who want to improve their current development environment on an existing Shopify theme that cannot be converted easily to using [Shopify Slate](https://github.com/Shopify/slate). If you are starting a Shopify custom theme project from scratch, I recomend using [Shopify Slate](https://github.com/Shopify/slate) instead :)
